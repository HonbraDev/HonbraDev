### Hi there

I have decided to make my profile private since GitHub doesn't give me the option of only hiding certain things from it and I don't really like the concept of everything I ever did here being listed in a single place. I'll try adding my contribution graph here when I get a sudden burst of motivation.

#### Pinned repositories

- [skolaonline-rs](https://github.com/HonbraDev/skolaonline-rs) - A collection of Rust crates for interacting with the Czech edutech provider Å kola OnLine
- [honbra-web](https://github.com/HonbraDev/honbra-web) - My personal website with React.js shitposts - currently being rewritten

#### Pinned organizations

- [Goobers, Inc.](https://github.com/GoobersInc) - Me and a couple of others making silly Minecraft things, mostly private stuff for now
